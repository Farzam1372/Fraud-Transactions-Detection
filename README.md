# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project

## Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. The primary goal is to compare the effectiveness of different models in accurately identifying fraud.

## Aim

- Develop a robust model for fraud detection.
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
- Select the best model based on evaluation metrics.

## Structure

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading, cleaning, and scaling data.
2. **Model Training**: Implementing KNN, Neural Network, and K-Means models.
3. **Evaluation**: Using precision, recall, and F1-score for comparison.
4. **Visualization**: PCA for data distribution and model performance visualization.
5. **Conclusion**: Summarizing and recommending the best model.

## Methodology

1. **Data Handling**: Loaded, cleaned, and scaled data; addressed imbalances.
2. **Model Implementation**: Trained KNN, Neural Network, and K-Means models.
3. **Evaluation**: Compared models using precision, recall, and F1-score; used PCA for visualization.
4. **Results**: Neural Network outperformed others with an F1-score and recall of 0.964.

## Conclusion

The **Neural Network** model is the best performer for credit card fraud detection, achieving the highest F1-score and recall, making it the most reliable.

## Future Work

- Experiment with more algorithms.
- Fine-tune model hyperparameters.
- Explore advanced techniques for data imbalance.
- Implement real-time detection systems.
